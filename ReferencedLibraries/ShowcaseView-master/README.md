ShowcaseView
====

The ShowcaseView (SCV) library is designed to highlight and showcase specific parts of apps to the user with a distinctive and attractive overlay. This library is great for pointing out points of interest for users, gestures, or obscure but useful items.

<img src='./example2@2x.png' width='270' height='480' />

The library is based on the "Cling" view found in the Launcher on Ice-Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean.

Project set-up
====

**ShowcaseView currently supports API LEVEL 11+**

If you're using a Gradle-based project, then you can add SCV as a dependency directly:

~~~
compile 'com.github.amlcurran.showcaseview:library:5.0.0'
~~~

If you're using Maven (but not Gradle), you can add the APKlib as a dependency:

~~~
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.amlcurran.showcaseview</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
  <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
~~~

If you're using a standard project without either Maven or Gradle, you'll have to download the project, and the add the library manually to your project.


Usage
====

To use ShowcaseView, use the Builder pattern.

As an example:

~~~
new ShowcaseView.Builder(this)
    .setTarget(new ActionViewTarget(this, ActionViewTarget.Type.HOME))
    .setContentTitle("ShowcaseView")
    .setContentText("This is highlighting the Home button")
    .hideOnTouchOutside()
    .build();
~~~

You can use styles to customise how a ShowcaseView looks. I'll write more documentation soon, but for now, check out the sample project's [styles](https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView/blob/master/sample/src/main/res/values/styles.xml).

Sample Project
----
There's a sample project available which you can find in the project, or as an app on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espian.showcaseview.sample).

What's the legacy branch?
----
The [legacy branch](https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView/tree/legacy) is still available for people to use. This has more features than the master branch, but it more unwieldy to use and less stable. I don't support it at all - you'll have to build and compile it yourself. It isn't available on Maven Central either.

Is it worth using?
----
Perhaps. Why not ask
[Google](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android),
[HaxSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mots.haxsync), or [AllCast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast), which each use the library?

What's missing in v5
---

- ShowcaseViews: the class which queues up ShowcaseViews in a tutorial-type method. I never
really liked this class (generally, you should use SCV sparingly); I'll add it back in based on
the Builder class when I can.
- Ghostly hand: this has gone for now until I can test-drive it back in.
- Scale multiplier: this has gone for simplicity - if people really loved it I'll add in back in

FAQs
---

**Where has X feature gone?**

Look one paragraph up!

**Waaaah, but I really liked feature X!!!**

Switch to the legacy branch and use that one then! All legacy features are in there.

**What happened to all the other constructors?**

Gone. You should be using the new Target API.

**What if I want to add feature X?**

At the moment, I'm not taking any feature requests. It's unlikely I'll take many anyway,
unless I feel they are both useful and well tested. If you have some cosmetic tweak then I don't
want that added into the library as *another* option. But, if you need to make a tweak to the
library to add such a tweak to your own, overridden ShowcaseView then that is totally great.
